# scrape_action


Obtain lines from 

https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/public-betting

or swap out nba with any other avaiable sport. 


To run, 

```
$ python scrape_action.py
```


and have fun with the data for today's lines in a given sport. Feel free to change the sport to scrape, path of output, and let me know if you have any cool implementations you can think of for a tool like this.
