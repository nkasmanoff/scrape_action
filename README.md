# scrape_action

This is a REALLY basic web scraping tool I created since I can't seem to find a pre-existing API for action network's vast amount of betting data. Theres's certainly much more to do with this site and available information, but I'll leave that as an excersice for a later time. For now, I've created a basic python script which once given the proper path and sport (currently directly outputs NBA data to this repository) retrieves the current and opening lines and odds for today's games. 

Hopefully someone has fun with the data, would love to know what more there is to do! 

Feel free to change the sport to scrape, path of output, and let me know if you have any cool implementations you can think of for a tool like this, would be very interested in collaborating further.


Obtain lines from 

https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/public-betting

or swap out nba with any other avaiable sport. 


To run, 

```
$ python scrape_action.py
```
